        THIS PRIVACY POLICY DISCLOSES THE PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR THE TRAITQUEST PLATFORM. TRAITQUEST, THE PROVIDER OF THE PLATFORM
        (REFERRED TO AS “US” OR “TRAITQUEST”), IS COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THE USER’S PRIVACY ONLINE IN COMPLIANCE WITH PERSONAL
        DATA PROTECTION ACT 2010 (“THE ACT”). PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TO LEARN WHAT INFORMATION TRAITQUEST COLLECTS FROM THE USER

        <li>CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY
          <ol>
            <li>
              If TraitQuest decides to change the Privacy Policy, TraitQuest will post those changes to this Privacy Policy,
              the homepage, and other places TraitQuest deems appropriate so that the User is aware of what information TraitQuest
              collects, how TraitQuest uses it, and under what circumstances, if any, TraitQuest discloses it.
            </li>
            <li>
              TraitQuest reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently.
              If TraitQuest makes substantial (to which degree is at the sole discretion of the TraitQuest’s team)
              changes to this Privacy Policy, TraitQuest will notify the Users here, by email, or by means of notice on
              TraitQuest’s home page.

        <li>TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED AND USES OF COLLECTED INFORMATION
          <ol>
            <li>
              TraitQuest collects two types of information about the Users: Personally Identifiable Information and
              Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information is information that pertains to a
              specific End User. When the User engages in certain activities on the Platform, such as as creating and managing
              an account, utilization of services and products from TraitQuest and/or authorized third party service providers,
              filling out a survey, posting a review, sending TraitQuest feedback, requesting information about TraitQuest’s
              services, posting a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Website (collectively,
              “Identification Activities”), TraitQuest may ask the User to provide certain information about the User. It is
              optional for the User to engage in an Identification Activity. If the User elects to engage in an Identification
              Activity, however, TraitQuest may ask the User to provide TraitQuest with certain personal information about the
              User, such as login username and password, personal data (full name), e-mail address, postal address and contact
              phone number. When the User makes an order for TraitQuest’s Services, TraitQuest may also ask the User to provide
              TraitQuest with the User’s credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information.
              Depending on the activity, some of the information TraitQuest asks the User to provide is identified as mandatory
              and some is identified as voluntary. If the User does not provide the mandatory information for a particular
              activity that requires it, the User will not be permitted to engage in that activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              TraitQuest uses Personally Identifiable Information for the following purposes:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Notify and/or provide products and services to the User;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Creation, management and maintenance of an account;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Processing of the User's inquiries and operations at the Platform;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enhances the operation of the Platform;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Improves TraitQuest’s marketing and promotional efforts;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Data analysis for the purposes of improving offered goods, products or technologies;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintenance of operation of interactive areas;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Realization of communication and contacts on matters concerning transactions made by the User; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Provision and display of the content specially chosen in accordance with preferences and interests
                  of the User and to tailor the User’s experiences with third parties as provided in Section 3 of this
                  Privacy Policy.
                </li>
                If the User sends TraitQuest’s customer service an email TraitQuest may use the User’s comments and feedback to
                tell others about TraitQuest’s services, and may post the User’s comments in TraitQuest’s marketing materials or
                on TraitQuest’s Platform. The User’s comments may contain personal information such as the User’s name, TraitQuest
                will obtain consent from the User to post the User’s name along with the comment prior to posting the comment for
                public view. In addition, if the User uses TraitQuest’s Platform to send information or a product to another
                person, TraitQuest may store the User’s personal information. TraitQuest may also use Personally Identifiable
                Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact the User, enforce
                TraitQuest’s agreements with the User, including this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate
                with law enforcement activities.
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not
              identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator
              (“URL”) of the Platform the User visited before coming to TraitQuest’s Platform, the URL of the Platform the
              User visits after leaving TraitQuest’s Platform, the type of browser the User is using and Internet Protocol
              (“IP”) address. TraitQuest and/or authorized Third Party Service Providers and advertisers, may automatically
              collect this information when the User visits TraitQuest’s Platform through the use of electronic tools like Cookies
              and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy. TraitQuest uses Non-Personally
              Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Platform, analyze trends, gather demographic information,
              comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. TraitQuest may also share this information
              with TraitQuest’s authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of
              TraitQuest’s online advertising, content, and programming.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>RELEASE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
          <ul>
            <li>
              TraitQuest will not share, sell, rent, or trade the User’s Personally Identifiable Information with
              other parties except as provided below.
            </li>
            <li>
              TraitQuest may share the User’s information with particular or potential third party service providers.
              From time to time, TraitQuest provides offers from particular or potential third party service providers who,
              as part of the offer, request information on TraitQuest customers. Sharing this Information may allow a third
              party provider to market directly to the User should the User choose to do so. However, TraitQuest will only
              share Personally Identifiable Information with a third party service provider if the User engages in an
              Identification Activity, and then only to the third party service provider involved in that Identification Activity.
              TraitQuest specifically disclaims any responsibility or liability for the actions of such third party service
              provider. While TraitQuest informs them that they are only permitted to communicate with the User for the purposes
              of the specific promotion with TraitQuest, TraitQuest does not have any responsibility for the actions of the third
              party service provider, and the actions of the third party service provider are not in our control.
            </li>
            <li>
              TraitQuest may share the User's information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers (“Service Providers”).
              TraitQuest provides services and products through third parties. These Service Providers perform functions on
              TraitQuest’s behalf, like sending out and distributing TraitQuest’s administrative and promotional emails or text
              messages. TraitQuest may share the User's Personally Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to fulfill
              orders, deliver packages, send postal or email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on
              customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card
              payments, operate the Platform, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. TraitQuest may also collect personal
              information from individuals and companies (“Affiliates”) with whom TraitQuest has business relationships and may
              share the User's information with Service Providers to accomplish TraitQuest’s administrative tasks. For example,
              when the User orders a service, TraitQuest releases the User’s credit card information to the card-issuing bank to
              confirm payment for the service and, if applicable, release the User's address to the delivery service to deliver
              the service. Likewise, TraitQuest may release information to TraitQuest’s bank to send out a payment. TraitQuest
              encourages the Service Providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of the User's Personally
              Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to
              TraitQuest’s control.
            </li>
            <li>
              TraitQuest may remarket the User's information. Remarketing is a way for TraitQuest to connect with users,
              based upon the User's past interactions with the TraitQuest Platform. Third-party marketing vendors may be hired
              by TraitQuest to perform remarketing services. As a result, third-party vendors, including Google, may show
              TraitQuest’s ads on sites on the internet. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based
              on a user's prior visits to TraitQuest's Platform. Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the
              Google advertising opt-out page at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html. This information is used only for
              remarketing purposes and will not be used by Google for any other purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              TraitQuest may share the User's information in a Business Transfer as with any other business,
              TraitQuest could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire
              the information TraitQuest maintains, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally
              Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
              TraitQuest reserves the right to disclose the User's personally identifiable information as required by law and
              when TraitQuest believes that disclosure is necessary to protect TraitQuest’s rights and/or comply with a judicial
              proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Platform; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy or other
              agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Platform, its Users or others.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>RELEASE OF NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
          <ol>
            <li>
              TraitQuest may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with authorized Third Party Service
              Providers and Advertisers. For example, TraitQuest may share aggregated demographic information
              (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with “Third Party Advertisers” or
              “Third Party Advertising Companies” and other parties.
            </li>
            <li>
              TraitQuest uses Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when the User visits our Platform.
              These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about the User's visits to this and other
              sites in order to provide, through the use of network tags, advertisements about goods and services that may be
              of interest to the User.
            </li>
            <li>
              TraitQuest also uses Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume
              statistical information from TraitQuest’s Users to administer TraitQuest’s Platform and constantly improve its quality.
              TraitQuest may also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for advertisers.
              Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries of the activities of
              TraitQuest’s Users. Such data is collected on TraitQuest’s behalf, and is owned and used by TraitQuest.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>UPDATING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION
          <ol>
            <li>
              TraitQuest believes that the User should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable
              Information the User provides TraitQuest. The User may change any of the User's Personally Identifiable Information
              by logging into the User's account and accessing the "My Account" section of the Platform, sending TraitQuest an
              email at hello@traitquest.com. Please indicate the User's name, address and email address, and what information the
              User would like to update when the User contacts TraitQuest. TraitQuest encourages the User to promptly update the
              User's Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. the User may ask to have the information on the User's
              account deleted or removed; however, because TraitQuest keeps track of past transactions, the User cannot delete
              information associated with past transactions on the Platform. In addition, in may be impossible for TraitQuest
              to completely delete all of the User's information because TraitQuest periodically backups information.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>USER CHOICES ON COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION
          <ol>
            <li>
              As discussed above, the User can always choose not to provide information, although it may be required to engage in
              a certain activity on the Platform. As a condition of redemption of TraitQuest’s products and services, TraitQuest
              will send the User Administrative emails. TraitQuest will send the User information regarding the User's account
              activity. The User cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. “Administrative Emails” relate to a User's activity on
              the Platform, and include emails regarding a particular User's account, requests or inquiries, and redemption of
              products and services.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>SECURITY OF INFORMATION
          <ol>
            <li>
              TraitQuest takes security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security of Personally
              Identifiable Information. The User can access the User's Personally Identifiable Information on TraitQuest’s
              Platform through a password and the User's email address. This password is encrypted. TraitQuest recommends that
              the User does not share the User's password with anyone. In addition, the User's Personally Identifiable Information
              resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. TraitQuest encrypts certain
              sensitive information (such as credit card information) using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that
              the User's Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to TraitQuest. Unfortunately, no data
              transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while
              TraitQuest employs commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies
              which do the same, TraitQuest cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Platform,
              and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.
            </li>

        <li>DATA TRACKING
          <ol>
            <li>
              Cookies. To facilitate and customize the User's experience with the Platform, TraitQuest stores cookies on the
              User’s computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User's computer for record-keeping purposes
              which contains information about that User. TraitQuest uses cookies to save the User’s time while using the
              Platform, reminds TraitQuest who the User is, tracks and targets User interests in order to provide a customized
              experience. Cookies also allow TraitQuest to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from the User, like
              which pages the User visited and what links the User clicked on. Use of this information helps TraitQuest to create
              a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition, TraitQuest may use Third Party Advertising Companies
              to display advertisements on TraitQuest’s Platform. As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on the
              User's computer. TraitQuest has no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
              cookies by TraitQuest’s Platform only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser. Most browsers
              automatically accept cookies, but the User may be able to modify the User's browser settings to decline cookies.
              Please note that if the User decline or delete these cookies, some parts of the Platform may not work properly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other Tracking Devices. TraitQuest may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons
              to track the User's usage of the Platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              The use of TraitQuest’s Platform pages and promotions, or TraitQuest may allow our Third Party Service Providers
              to use these devices on TraitQuest’s behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain
              pages on our Platform, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether the User has performed a specific action.
              When the User access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally
              Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow TraitQuest to measure and improve TraitQuest’s understanding
              of visitor traffic and behavior on TraitQuest’s Platform, as well as give TraitQuest a way to measure TraitQuest’s
              promotions and performance. TraitQuest may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or
              Service Providers for the same purposes.

        <li>PRIVACY POLICIES OF THIRD PARTY SITES
          <ol>
            <li>
              This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information TraitQuest collect from the User on
