        <li>TERM, GROUNDS AND PRINCIPLES OF TERMINATION
          <ol>
            <li>
              This Agreement is effective until the moment of its termination. For such purpose at any time the User should send
              a message using the Platform’s Contact Form or by any other written form appropriate for him/her, which identifies

              or some content and resources of the Platform at any time, for any reason and without proofs or prior notices
            </li>
            <li>
              TraitQuest has the ability and right to suspend, terminate or change any part of the Platform or the Platform in the

            </li>
            <li>
              A termination agreement does not indicate automatic exemption of liability and obligation of reimbursement of debts
              to TraitQuest in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or other liabilities of the User, namely:
              not to use the Platform files or other content presented within its resources by ways other than those permitted with
              the terms and provisions of this Agreement that were valid by the moment of said use. This Agreement will be
              terminated without derogations or impairment to the rights of TraitQuest, limitations and defense of liabilities
              provided in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, which defense, limitations of liabilities and rights shall
              survive this Agreement’s termination.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upon termination of the User profile and his/her access to the Platform files, the User confirms his/her consent to
